To add support for MQTT to an existing project, you must first add a <<v3dependency, dependency>> to your build depending on the version of MQTT <<v3dependency, v3>> or <<v5dependency, v5>> you require.

IMPORTANT: If you are running into the exception `org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3.MqttException: Timed out waiting for a response from the server`, please make sure to run your program on a machine with *more than one core*. The Eclipse Paho MQTT client will run into connection timeouts if it has only one core available.
