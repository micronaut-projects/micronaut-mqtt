MQTT supports publisher acknowledgements that behave different based on the qos of the message being sent. The broker will acknowledge the message and then that will cause the publishing method to complete. For publishers that return `void`, that means the method will block the current thread until the acknowledgement is received. For futures and reactive types, they will complete after the acknowledgement is received.

Since the publisher is cold, the message will not actually be published until the stream is subscribed to.

For example:

snippet::io.micronaut.mqtt.docs.publisher.acknowledge.ProductClient[tags="imports,clazz"]

<1> A `Publisher` can be returned to be able to know when the message was acknowledged. Any other reactive type can be used given the appropriate dependencies are in place.
<2> Java futures can also be used
