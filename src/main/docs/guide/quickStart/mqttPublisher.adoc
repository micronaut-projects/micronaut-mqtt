To create an MQTT client that produces messages you can simply define an interface that is annotated with `MqttPublisher`.

For example the following is a trivial `MqttPublisher` interface:

snippet::io.micronaut.mqtt.docs.quickstart.ProductClient[tags="imports,clazz"]

<1> The `MqttPublisher` annotation is used to designate this interface as a client.
<2> The ann:mqtt.annotation.Topic[] annotation indicates which topic the message should be published to.
<3> The `send` method accepts single parameter which is the payload of the message.

At compile time Micronaut will produce an implementation of the above interface. You can retrieve an instance of `ProductClient` either by looking up the bean from the link:{apimicronaut}context/ApplicationContext.html[ApplicationContext] or by injecting the bean with `@Inject`:

snippet::io.micronaut.mqtt.docs.quickstart.QuickstartSpec[tags="producer"]

NOTE: Because the `send` method returns `void` this means the method will publish the message and block until the broker acknowledges the message.
