A ann:mqtt.annotation.Topic[] annotation is required for a method to be a subscriber of messages from MQTT. Simply apply the annotation to the method and supply the name of the topic you would like to listen to. Multiple topics can be subscribed to by supplying multiple annotations. Each topic can have its own qos value set in the annotation.
