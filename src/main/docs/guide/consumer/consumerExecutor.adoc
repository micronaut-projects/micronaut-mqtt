MQTT allows an link:{jdkapi}/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html[ExecutorService] to be supplied for new connections. The service is used to execute subscribers. A single connection is used for the entire application and it is configured to use the `consumer` named executor service. The executor can be configured through application configuration. See link:{apimicronaut}scheduling/executor/ExecutorConfiguration.html[ExecutorConfiguration] for the full list of options.

For example:

.Configuring the `consumer` thread pool
[configuration]
----
micronaut:
    executors:
        consumer:
            type: scheduled
            corePoolSize: 25
----

If no configuration is supplied, a scheduled thread pool with 2 times the amount of available processors is used.

NOTE: The executor type *must* be `scheduled`.
