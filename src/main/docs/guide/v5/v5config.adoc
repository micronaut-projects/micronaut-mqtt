All properties on the 'MqttConnectionOptions' are available to be modified, either through configuration or a link:{apimicronaut}context/event/BeanCreatedEventListener.html[BeanCreatedEventListener].

The properties that can be converted from the string values in a configuration file can be configured directly.

include::{includedir}configurationProperties/io.micronaut.mqtt.v5.config.MqttClientConfigurationProperties.adoc[]

NOTE: Without any configuration the defaults in the 'MqttConnectionOptions' will be used.

TIP: It is also possible to disable the integration entirely with `rabbitmq.enabled: false`
